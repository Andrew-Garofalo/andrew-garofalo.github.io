>>>>    Github Workflow:

>> Since we are all pushing directly to the master branch, 
   here are basic steps to follow to avoid deleting each other's
   work or having our own work overwritten.

1. git add and git commit any progress in your local copy

2. git pull (Resolve any merge conflicts here)
	2a. can use git status to see a list of all the affected files
	2b. files with merge conflicts will have "both modified: " next
		to their names.
	2c. open each file and fix merge conflict
	
3. git push
